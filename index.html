<p>Since my Prusa MK3S printer is sitting on a shelf with low headroom, I can't use the top mounted spool holders. This is my simple design of a filament guide, that allows me to use a spool holder that is sitting next to my printer.


  The <strong>MK3FilamentGuide</strong> is a hight adjustable bed for K40 laser cutters and clones..
